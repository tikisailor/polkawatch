# Polkawatch Archive

Archiving is the first-pass of the polkawatch 2-pass indexing process. 

Archiving extracts the canonical substrate chain data that is required to create the polkawatch 
index. In the second pass, the canonical data will be enriched with external datasources.

## Toolchain

Archiving is implemented as a subQuery project.
