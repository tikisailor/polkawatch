# Adding LQS Queries

Adding more endpoints and queries to LQS is a simple process. The general principle is that query specifications, as
generated by Kibana, can be templated and instrumented with request parameters.

It is also possible to transform the output into a domain specific response.

## Steps

- After indexing the blockchain with polkawatch-archive
- Create a visualization in Kibana dashboard with the interative interface
- Obtain the query specification using the inspect/request menu
- Create a new query controller in this directory, and register it in ```index.ts```
- Provide the query specification as the ```queryTemplate```
- Use one of the available request parameters DTOs or create your own
- Use one of the available response parameters DTOs or create your own
- Use the interactive UI to test during development
- Add end to end test and regression test for your new endpoint

 Note that most queries, parameters and response specifications follow similar structure.
